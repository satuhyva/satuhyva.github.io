          <p class="info_history">
            My father, a lawyer, did not see any point in getting our family a Commodore 64.
            So I did not grow up with computers.
            On the contrary, I learned to consider computers intimidating and to use paper and pen instead.
            Even much, much later, when working as a researcher in a scientific biochemistry laboratory,
            paper and pen were still perhaps more important tools for me than any software.
        </p>
          <p class="info_history">
            Then, in 2017, I heard about Xcode and the possibility to develop apps for your own iPhone.
            That instant I rushed to a store and got myself a Mac.
            Shortly after I had my first app (a Flappy bird with a fish theme) running on my iPhone.
            Later (when introducing speech recognition to a recipe app) I realized I need basic training in programming.
            So I started attending programming MOOCs.
            I took as many courses as my full-time job as an R&D biochemist allowed.
          </p>
          <p class="info_history">
            But I just couldn’t get enough of programming!
            Then, in 2020, I decided to ditch biochemistry.
            Since then I have worked full-time as a software developer
            and I love all of it! The only problem is that there are too many exiting and cool technologies
            and features (and new ones appear constantly) but there is not enough time to learn them all.
